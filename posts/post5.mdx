# 👁️👁️ Vanished Worlds: April Development Preview 👁️👁️

We have a major Vanished Worlds update in the works 🛠️🛠️🛠️
Here's a little preview of the new content you'll experience in the Experimental Branch later this month, and shortly after as part of the first big EA update! 

New Area: The Furrowstead,
The gates to the Furrowstead shall soon be open! Previously referred to as the 'farm area', this new level 7-8 area will be our largest combat map to date—featuring two unique boss-tier encounters, fearsome new enemies, puzzles, and sidequests! Will you uncover the truth behind the corruption that plagues Gladeheim?

New Companion: Persephone,
Attentive guildies might have already noticed the new companion who will soon be able to join your ranks. Persephone wields a rather unique set of skills which will prove invaluable in the challenges you will soon face deeper into Respite Island. Just be sure not to miss her during your travels...

System Overhaul: Crafting & Itemization,
We are performing a comprehensive crafting overhaul to increase the overall enjoyment of looting and exploration. To start, crafting recipes will now be discovered simply by gathering ingredients while you travel. You'll also be able to forge rings that grant new skills, plus unique "crafted gear" that you won't be able to find anywhere else!

New Mechanic: Ambush,
You will soon be able to enter "Scouting Mode" before entering battle. This will allow you to ambush unsuspecting enemies, or avoid battles altogether more easily. When you attempt an ambush, members of both sides with the highest Initiative value will roll to see who gains a bonus turn when combat begins!

UI Upgrades,
We are starting improvements to both the merchant and crafting interfaces. You will soon be able to see your party's combined inventory in a single view, making it easier to keep track of your belongings.
